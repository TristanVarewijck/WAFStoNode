## API

<img src="https://github.com/TristanVarewijck/TechDefined/blob/main/assets/images/newApi-LOGO.jpeg" alt="newsapi-logo" width="200px"/>

For this project i am using the NewsAPI from - [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) <br>
To search on the app im using the endpoints below with the following params:

This one is so i can search articles for specific topics:
[https://newsapi.org/v2/everything](https://newsapi.org/v2/everything)

|  Key  |    q    |   sortBy    | language | pageSize |  apiKey  |
| :---: | :-----: | :---------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| value | {input} | publishedAt |    en    |   100    | {apiKey} |

this one is so i can see the latest headlines in a specific category:
[https://newsapi.org/v2/headlines](https://newsapi.org/v2/headlines)

|  Key  | country |  category  | pageSize |  apiKey  |
| :---: | :-----: | :--------: | :------: | :------: |
| value |   us    | technology |   100    | {apiKey} |

:rotating_light: : As explained earlier the API is not usable outside your localhost, for this project i used the **FREE version** of this API.

## ToDoList

In addition to the features that are now available, there are also additional features and tweaks that can make the app better. Do you have ideas let them know in a [PR](https://github.com/TristanVarewijck/TechDefined/pulls) :white_check_mark:

- [x] Detail pages (data)
- [ ] Locomotive scroll testing
- [ ] Working filter buttons
- [x] JS refactoring
- [ ] Keep-scroll position
- [x] No refresh on page switch
- [ ] Reponsiveness

## Usage

For using this app yourself you need to follow the following steps:

### 1. Clone Repo locally

```
git clone https://github.com/TristanVarewijck/TechDefined.git
```

### 2. Connect your API key

If you want to connect with the API you have to fill in your own personal {apiKey} wich you can get here: <br>
[Get NewsAPI apiKey](https://newsapi.org/).

```
https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=${input.value}&sortBy=publishedAt&language=en&pageSize=100&apiKey=${apiKey}
https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&category=technology&pageSize=100&apiKey=${apiKey}
```

### 3. Run on Localhost

Because i am using the free version of this API your need to run it on your localhost to test it. If you want to move further with this app make sure to check out the [pricing scheme](https://newsapi.org/pricing) of NewsAPI.

For easily running this project on your localhost you can use a VSCODE extension named: <br>
[live-server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

After installing this extension make sure to reload en hit the "Go Live" button.

### Thats it! :smile:
